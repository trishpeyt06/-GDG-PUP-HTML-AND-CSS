    <h2>About Me!</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Trisha. I'm currently a web development cadet in GDG. I just turned 18 years old not while ago
    and as a freshman in college, <br>I'm just now beginning to grasp things and get used to my new environment here in PUP Manila.  
    <br> I don't have enough experience with programming. I don't know enough about programming. Despite 
    my ongoing struggles with programming,<br> I hope that my time at GDG would allow me to explore, have fun, and develop my skills.</p>
    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I have lots of hobbies. I like to sing and listen to music, any genre will do but I listen to pop and country the most.<br>
    Sometimes, when on the mood, I also like to dance and draw digitally or traditionally.<br>I also watch a lot of movies! RomComs are my favorite movie genre to watch. 
    Aside from sleeping, watching movies and listening to music are my coping mechanisms :)).</p>
